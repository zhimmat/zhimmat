      <h1>What Johnny can't read</h1>
      <p>"What Johnny can't read" is a book on censorship in American libraries written by Rudolf Flesch. A magazine layout was best suited for a section of this book with compelling images to not only attract the viewers eyes but to tie the whole story together. Looking at the cover image with the title you can understand what the article would be about. I used left justified text to work with the centered grid I was using for readability purposes. </p>
