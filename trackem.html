      <h1>Track em</h1>
      <p>Have you ever asked yourself "Where is my bus?"
Living in Ottawa I've always asked myself that question so I decided to come up with an app that allows the users to track their bus and to be able to see it in real time. With that being said, users are now able to open their phone, click a certain bus number, and the app will open a GPS showing you that bus.</p>
